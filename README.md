# Porsche Mission X

**Why**
<P>
Porsche Mission X was a project for me to learn Jetpack Compose and to use the MVVM architecture. Having worked on Android applications at a personal and commercial level for quite some time it was good to be using a newer technology.
</P>

**What I learnt**
<P>
Jetpack Compose is a welcome improvement to the XML layout. I enjoyed working with compose which is simple yet powerful. Alongside Jetpack Navigation writing good quality maintainble code with thi is very easy.

Alongside jetpack I used Hilt for dependency injection having previously been using either Dagger (on which Hilt is based) and Koin. 

Coil is used for image loading.
</P>

**Still to do**
<P>
This project is provided as/is and is all my own work. The intent is for it to be a sample project and good quality code. Although it is using a reasonable code structure I think this could be improved and wonder about separating out the compose functions from the actual screen. This would make more sense if creating components that could be reusable. As it stands there's probably no real benefit to doing this separation right now. I shall be taking this as a starting point from which to develop apps for play store deployment.
